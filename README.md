**Problem Statement:**
Many people find it difficult to decide what to cook based on the ingredients they have at home. Searching for recipes manually takes time and doesn’t always match what’s available in their kitchen. Additionally, it’s hard to imagine how the final dish will look.
There is a clear need for a smart system that:
•	Accepts a list of ingredients and instantly produces a matching recipe.
•	Analyzes a food image and suggests a full recipe based on visual cues.
•	Displays a professional image of the final dish.
•	Offers interactive guidance on alternatives and improvements.
