**Problem Statement:**

Many people find it difficult to decide what to cook based on the ingredients they have at home. Searching for recipes manually takes time and doesn’t always match what’s available in their kitchen. Additionally, it’s hard to imagine how the final dish will look.
There is a clear need for a smart system that:
•	Accepts a list of ingredients and instantly produces a matching recipe.
•	Analyzes a food image and suggests a full recipe based on visual cues.
•	Displays a professional image of the final dish.
•	Offers interactive guidance on alternatives and improvements. 

**Tools:**

**Frontend**
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript – Used to build a responsive and interactive user interface.
Animate.css, Font Awesome – Enhance the UI with smooth animations and a rich set of icons for an engaging user experience.

**Backend**
Flask (Python Web Framework) – Powers the backend by managing routing, server-side logic, and communication between the UI and the machine learning model.

**Google Gemini API** – Utilized for intelligent generation of textual content such as dynamic recipe recommendations.

**Stable Diffusion (via Hugging Face Diffusers)** – Transforms recipe data into high-quality visual dish images to complement the user experience.
